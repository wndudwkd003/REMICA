{"id": "GabHate_test_4197", "text": "THere is a very good reason why Social Security was setup the way it is so that even the richest rich get their Social Security.  The reason is valid today and also applies to healthcare. The designers of Social Security considered means testing for benefits but they quickly realized that if you do that, you immediately turn it into a welfare program.  The wealthier people who put a lot of money into it but get nothing out of it come to (naturally) resent it and resent those who are living off their money.  That program loses support over time and then gets ended or gutted in various ways.  By making sure EVERYONE puts into Social Security and EVERYONE gets out of Social Security, the \"welfare\" label doesn't apply and everyone can still support it.  I do not support means testing Social Security.  I support eliminating the income cap for paying into Social Security instead. The fee should be a flat percent of income, for ALL people, rich and poor.  Do that and its solvency is no longer an issue.    If you make universal healthcare a welfare system where the rich or wealthier people pay in but then also have to pay more just for their own personal healthcare, they WILL resent this and fight to end it.  I'm not sure what the answer is but isn't a simple fix.  Be careful about saying healthcare is a \"right\".  It sounds nice but what it actually means is that you are claiming that people are ENTITLED to someone else's labor. NO ONE is entitled to YOUR labor, or MY labor. ", "label": 0, "metadata": {}}

One LEO had \"Counter-Terrorism\" on the back of his.
